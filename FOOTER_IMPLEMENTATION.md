# Footer Implementation Documentation

## Overview

A beautiful, responsive footer has been implemented for the Wayback Wednesday website, featuring social media links to G-Bo The Pro's social channels and essential site navigation.

## Components Created

### 1. Main Footer (`src/components/Footer/Footer.tsx`)

The main footer appears on all public pages (except the homepage) and includes:

- **Brand Section**: Wayback Wednesday branding and tagline
- **Quick Links**: Navigation to About, Shop, Events, and Contact pages
- **Social Media Section**: Links to Instagram, Threads, and TikTok with custom icons
- **Legal Links**: Privacy Policy and Terms of Service
- **Copyright Information**: Dynamic year and rights reserved notice
- **Easter Egg**: "EST. 2025 • EAST HARLEM • KEEPING THE CULTURE ALIVE"

### 2. Hero Footer (`src/components/Footer/HeroFooter.tsx`)

A minimal, overlay-style footer for the homepage that:

- Appears over the video background
- Shows social links in a horizontal layout
- Uses a gradient background for readability
- Maintains visibility without disrupting the hero experience

## Social Media Links

The footer includes links to G-Bo The Pro's official social media accounts:

| Platform  | Handle       | URL                             |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Instagram | @gbothepro   | https://instagram.com/gbothepro |
| Threads   | @gbothepro   | https://threads.net/@gbothepro  |
| TikTok    | @\_gbothepro | https://tiktok.com/@_gbothepro  |

## Design Features

### Visual Design

- **Background**: Rich black (`bg-rich-black`) matching the site's aesthetic
- **Text Colors**: White with varying opacity for hierarchy
- **Borders**: Subtle white borders with 10% opacity
- **Icons**: Custom SVG icons for each social platform
- **Hover Effects**: Smooth color transitions and background changes

### Responsive Design

- **Mobile**: Stacked layout with centered content
- **Tablet**: Two-column layout
- **Desktop**: Three-column grid with optimal spacing

### Accessibility

- Proper semantic HTML with `<footer>` element
- Links have clear labels and hover states
- External links include `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- Sufficient color contrast for readability

## Implementation Details

### File Structure

```
src/components/Footer/
├── Footer.tsx       # Main footer component
├── HeroFooter.tsx   # Homepage footer variant
└── index.ts         # Export barrel file
```

### Integration Points

1. **App.tsx**: Footer is conditionally rendered on non-homepage routes

   ```tsx
   {
     !isHomePage && <Footer />;
   }
   ```

2. **HomeHero.tsx**: HeroFooter is included at the bottom of the hero section
   ```tsx
   <HeroFooter />
   ```

### Styling Approach

- Uses Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Consistent with the site's design system
- Custom hover effects and transitions
- Grid layout for responsive behavior

## Features

### Main Footer Sections

1. **Brand Column**

   - Company name in alt-gothic font
   - Mission statement
   - Cultural messaging

2. **Quick Links Column**

   - Internal navigation
   - Hover effects
   - Consistent spacing

3. **Social Media Column**
   - Icon + text combination
   - Handle display
   - External link indicators

### Interactive Elements

- Hover states on all links
- Smooth color transitions (200ms)
- Background color changes on social icons
- Scale effects on hover

## Usage

The footer automatically appears on all pages except the homepage. No additional configuration is needed. The component is fully self-contained and manages its own state.

### Customization Options

To modify social links, edit the `socialLinks` array in either footer component:

```typescript
const socialLinks = [
  {
    name: "Instagram",
    handle: "@gbothepro",
    url: "https://instagram.com/gbothepro",
    icon: <svg>...</svg>,
  },
  // Add more social platforms here
];
```

To modify footer links, edit the `footerLinks` array:

```typescript
const footerLinks = [
  { name: "About", path: "/about" },
  { name: "Shop", path: "/shop" },
  // Add more links here
];
```

## Mobile Optimization

### Responsive Breakpoints

- **Small (< 640px)**: Single column, stacked elements
- **Medium (640px - 768px)**: Two columns
- **Large (> 768px)**: Three columns

### Touch Targets

- Minimum 44x44px touch targets
- Adequate spacing between links
- Larger click areas on mobile

## Performance

- Lightweight SVG icons (no external dependencies)
- No JavaScript animations (CSS only)
- Minimal DOM elements
- Efficient Tailwind classes

## SEO Benefits

- Semantic HTML structure
- Internal linking for better crawlability
- Social media presence indicators
- Copyright and legal information

## Maintenance

The footer requires minimal maintenance:

1. Update copyright year automatically via `new Date().getFullYear()`
2. Social links are centralized for easy updates
3. Consistent component structure for modifications
