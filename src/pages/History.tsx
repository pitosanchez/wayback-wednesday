              I launched Wayback Whensday in 2008 as a monthly event at
              Camaradas El Barrio, and before long it grew into a weekly that
              ran strong for a full decade, until 2018. The party was born out
              of my desire to reconnect with the music that first drew me into
              Hip Hop—a full-circle moment after stepping back from serious
              DJing in the early 2000s.

              Wayback Whensday quickly became more than just a party—it was a
              celebration of music across eras and genres, a space where
              nostalgia met discovery. Its success drew incredible talent
              through its doors: Black Rob blessed the stage, and iconic DJs
              like DJ Enuff, Breakbeat Lou, Doo Wop, and Tony Touch all joined
              in to keep the energy alive. What started as a personal return to
              my roots turned into a community staple that embodied the spirit
              of Hip Hop and the joy of shared musical memory.

              In April 2025, I rebooted Wayback Whensday as a monthly at Barrio
              BX, and it has already proven to be a great success—welcoming new
              audiences while staying true to the spirit that made the party
              legendary in the first place.
